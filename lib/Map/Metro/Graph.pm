    my $graph = Map::Metro->new('Stockholm')->parse;

    my $routing = $graph->routing_for('Universitetet',  'Kista');

    # And then it's traversing time. Also see the
    # Map::Metro::Plugin::Hook::PrettyPrinter hook
    say $routing->origin_station->name;
    say $routing->destination_station->name;

            say 'Transfer!' if $step->was_line_transfer;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is at the core of L<Map::Metro>. After a map has been parsed the returned instance of this class contains
the entire network (graph) in a hierarchy of objects.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 routing_for

    my $routing = $graph->routing_for($origin_station,  $destination_station);

C<$origin_station> and C<$destination_station> can be either a station id, a station name or a L<Station|Map::Metro::Graph::Station> object. Both are required, but they can be of different types.

Returns a L<Routing|Map::Metro::Graph::Routing>.

=head2 all_pairs

Takes no arguments. Returns an array reference of L<Routings|Map::Metro::Graph::Routing> between every combination of L<Stations|Map::Metro::Graph::Station>.


=head2 asps

L<Map::Metro> uses L<Graph> under the hood. This method returns the L<Graph/"All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)"> object returned
by the APSP_Floyd_Warshall() method. If you prefer to traverse the graph via this object, observe that the vertices is identified
by their C<line_station_id> in L<Map::Metro::Graph::LineStation>.

Call this method after creation if you prefer long startup times but faster searches.

=head2 full_graph

This returns the complete L<Graph> object created from parsing the map.

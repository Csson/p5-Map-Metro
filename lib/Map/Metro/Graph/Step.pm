=head1 DESCRIPTION

Steps are exactly like L<Connections::Map::Metro::Graph::Connection>, in that they describe the combination of two
specific L<LineStations|Map::Metro::Graph::LineStation>, and the 'cost' of travelling between them, but with an important
difference: A Step is part of a specific L<Route|Map::Metro::Graph::Route>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #* General form
    $ map-metro.pl <command> [ <city> ] [ <arguments> ]

    #* Prints the route using the PrettyPrinter hook plugin
    $ map-metro.pl route Stockholm 'Sundbybergs centrum' T-Centralen

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This collection of commands exposes several parts of the L<Map::Metro> api.

=head1 COMMANDS

If a command takes C<$city>, it is mandatory. Normally it should be a module name in the C<Map::Metro::Plugin::Map> namespace (but only the significant part is necessary). If, however, it contains
att least one dot it is assumed to be a file path to a map file. The map file is parsed via L<Map::Metro::Shim>.


=head2 map-metro.pl all_routes $city

Does B<route> for all stations in the C<Map::Metro::Plugin::Map::$city> map. This gets exponentially slower with bigger maps.


=head2 map-metro.pl available

Lists all installed maps on the system.



=head2 map-metro.pl graphviz $city --into=$file

Creates a png via L<GraphViz2>.

If I<into=$file> is given the png is saved with that filename, otherwise a timestamped file will be saved in the current directory.


=head2 map-metro.pl lines $city

Lists all lines in the C<Map::Metro::Plugin::Map::$city> map.


=head2 map-metro.pl metro_to_tube $city

Converts C<Map::Metro::Plugin::Map::$city> into a L<Map::Tube> ready xml-file. The file is saved in the current working directory with a timestamped filename.


=head2 map-metro.pl route $city $from $to

B<C<$from>>

Mandatory. The starting station, can be either a station id (integer), or a station name (string). Must be of the same type as B<C<$to>>. Use quotes if the name contains spaces.

B<C<$to>>

Mandatory. The finishing station, can be either a station id (integer), or a station name (string). Must be of the same type as B<C<$from>>. Use quotes if the name contains spaces.

Searches for routes in the C<Map::Metro::Plugin::Map::$city> between C<$from> and C<$to>.


=head2 map-metro.pl stations $city

Lists all stations in the  C<Map::Metro::Plugin::Map::$city> map. This displays station ids for easy search with B<route>.

Revision history for Map-Metro

{{$NEXT}}
 [API Changes]

 [Bug Fixes]

 [Documentation]
 - Added a short comparison between Map::Metro and Map::Tube.

 [Enhancements]
 - By default, paths are now only searched between the chosen stations. This leads to significantly improved performance when searching one/few routes per execution.
 - Remoted use of 'aliased', for an extra (and easy) performance gain.
 - Can override cost of line changes (to force route finder to follow lines). Undocumented.

 [Revision]

0.2002 2015-01-04T13:12:02Z CET
 [Meta]
 - Added prereq (was missing since the map api change in 0.1900)

0.2001 2015-01-03T11:48:46Z CET
 [Enhancements]
 - Added width option on lines.
 - MM::Cmd::Graphviz takes an optional string parameter to set custom
   lengths on edges. The string can alternatively be a path to a file
   containing the settings. This feature is undocumented.

0.2000 2015-01-02T22:51:13Z CET
 [Bug Fixes]
 - Comments (in the map file) must be at the beginning of a line, or
   preceeded only by whitespace.

 [Enhancements]
 - Lines can have options. So far only 'color'.

 [New Features]
 - Introduced graphviz command, which creates a schematic view of a
   network.

0.1901 2015-01-01T01:01:42Z CET
 [Documentation]
 - Mention Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::MapMetro::Map

0.1900 2014-12-30T22:16:46Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - The MM::Plugin::Map api is changed. The old api will continue to work
   for now (this is not a deprecation notice). The new api allows
   MM::Cmd::Serealize to know the version of the map.

 [Bug Fixes]
 - Removed next_line_station/previous_line_station from LineStation, and
   the setting of them in MM::Graph. These weren't used, and made it harder
   to map a network (eg Oslo) where a line stops at a station in one
   direction, but not in the other.

 [Enhancements]
 - MM::Cmd::Serealize now saves the Sereal-ized file in the
   File::ShareDir::dist_dir of the map distribution.
 - MM::Cmd::Deserealize can now also (for maps serealized starting with
   this version) deserealize maps given the city name (previously you could
   only give a file path).
 - If there is a Serealized file for the current map (and, if applicable,
   version), *and* no hooks are attached, then that file will be
   deserealized and used (instead of re-building the network).

0.1804 2014-12-19T19:17:48Z CET
 [Meta]
 - Add github as issue tracker/repo

0.1803 2014-12-15T14:15:34Z CET
 [Documentation]
 - Added a note on the performance issue on large maps.

 [Enhancements]
 - Added serealize and deserealize commands to MM::Cmd. Helps a bit with
   the performance issue.
 - By default, station names with diacritics (like å, ä and ö) are added
   with their diacritics removed as a search name. This can be turned off
   if it causes problems. See MM::Plugin::Map.

0.1802 2014-12-13T19:13:25Z CET
 [Bug Fixes]
 - Line ids can again be both letters and digits.

 [Documentation]
 - Fixed error in synopsis.

0.1801 2014-12-13T17:19:37Z CET
 [Bug Fixes]
 - available_maps() and map-metro.pl available works again.
 - MM::Emitter should use MM::Hook.

 [Enhancements]
 - Added notation to add extra names (for search and display) to stations.

0.1800 2014-12-13T15:12:14Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - Changed notation to describe segments where a line travels in one
   direction.

0.1702 2014-12-13T12:52:32Z CET
 [Bug Fixes]
 - Thanks to SREZIC:
 - Added missing prereqs
 - Fixed shebang in map-metro.pl

 [Meta]
 - Removed MooseX::Object::Pluggable prereq (replaced by Module::Pluggable
   in 0.1700)

0.1701 2014-12-13T02:04:19Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - Removed a couple of undocumented methods from LineStation. Their purpose
   is better handled by Step.

 [Bug Fixes]
 - Suppressed much warnings during build.

 [Enhancements]
 - Added one-way option to segments.
 - Rewrote Lines command to step through lines using Step (instead of
   LineStation).

0.1700 2014-12-12T23:54:30Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - Renamed routing_completed hook to before_add_routing.
 - Revamped plugin systems for maps.

 [Bug Fixes]
 - In the output from MM::Cmd::Station the last line wouldn't be printed.

 [Documentation]
 - Fleshed out hook example.

 [Enhancements]
 - Argument hooks to Map::Metro->new can now be a string (when only using
   one hook).
 - Added before_add_station hook.
 - Added original_name to Station, so if before_add_station changes the
   station's name, we can still search for the old name (esp when creating
   Segments, but also in routing_for()).
 - Added MM::Plugin::Hook::StreamStations, mostly as a hook example.

0.1600 2014-12-12T02:29:55Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - Removed add to_text() (and related) methods from MM::Graph::*.

 [Enhancements]
 - All relevant MM::Cmd classes are adapted to the new hook system.
 - Ensures that maps only resides in the MM::Plugin::Map namespace.

 [New Features]
 - Created an event/hook system (so far only emits 'routing_completed').
 - Implemented a MM::Plugin::Hook::PrettyPrinter that auto-prints on
   routing_completed.

0.1501 2014-12-11T15:39:01Z CET

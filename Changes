0.1800 2014-12-13T15:12:14Z CET

   direction.

   in 0.1700)

0.1701 2014-12-13T02:04:19Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - Removed a couple of undocumented methods from LineStation. Their purpose
   is better handled by Step.

 [Bug Fixes]
 - Suppressed much warnings during build.

 [Enhancements]
 - Added one-way option to segments.
 - Rewrote Lines command to step through lines using Step (instead of
   LineStation).

0.1700 2014-12-12T23:54:30Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - Renamed routing_completed hook to before_add_routing.
 - Revamped plugin systems for maps.

 [Bug Fixes]
 - In the output from MM::Cmd::Station the last line wouldn't be printed.

 [Documentation]
 - Fleshed out hook example.

 [Enhancements]
 - Argument hooks to Map::Metro->new can now be a string (when only using
   one hook).
 - Added before_add_station hook.
 - Added original_name to Station, so if before_add_station changes the
   station's name, we can still search for the old name (esp when creating
   Segments, but also in routing_for()).
 - Added MM::Plugin::Hook::StreamStations, mostly as a hook example.

0.1600 2014-12-12T02:29:55Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - Removed add to_text() (and related) methods from MM::Graph::*.

 [Enhancements]
 - All relevant MM::Cmd classes are adapted to the new hook system.
 - Ensures that maps only resides in the MM::Plugin::Map namespace.

 [New Features]
 - Created an event/hook system (so far only emits 'routing_completed').
 - Implemented a MM::Plugin::Hook::PrettyPrinter that auto-prints on
   routing_completed.
